 
The application is a simple currency converter written in the Racket 
programming language.  It should automatically open a connection at the 
local port when run in Dr. Racket--the model will remain persistent 
throughout browsing sessions, but will reset once Dr. Racket has been turned 
off.  The application converts a quantity in one currency to another and 
allows users to add new currencies to its database.

I wrote the project to better understand the basics of web-programming.  I 
drew heavily off a tutorial on web-programming in Racket that can be found 
here http://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/  Creating a application while 
working through the tutorial greatly increased my understanding of the 
material covered.
